# ADVANCED ENCRYPTION STANDARD (AES)

The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) specifies a FIPS-approved
cryptographic algorithm that can be used to protect electronic data. The AES algorithm is a
symmetric block cipher that can encrypt (encipher) and decrypt (decipher) information.
Encryption converts data to an unintelligible form called ciphertext; decrypting the ciphertext
converts the data back into its original form, called plaintext.
